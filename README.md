## Using Sinon for better unit testing

Each file in the `test` folder contains some examples for each topic.

## Usage

- Git clone this repository
- Install all required NPM packages by running `npm install`
- Install Karma globally by running `npm install -g karma`
- Run the tests via `karma start` or `npm test`
- Now every time you save a file, the tests will run automatically
- Press `ctrl+c` to terminate Karma
